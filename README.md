# AlertBridge

AlertBridge is a headless gateway that receives TradingView (or any bot) webhook alerts and translates them into authenticated Alpaca orders. It never contains trading strategy logicâ€”it only validates, applies risk rules, logs, and forwards orders.

## Features

- Webhook endpoint for receiving trading alerts
- Risk management rules (cooldown periods, PnL checks)
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Health check endpoint (`/healthz`)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Containerized deployment

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Alpaca API credentials

## Quickstart

1. Build and test:
   ```bash
   make build
   make test
   ```
2. Set required environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ALP_KEY=your_key
   export ALP_SECRET=your_secret
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./alertbridge
   ```
4. By default the server listens on port `8080`. Override with the `PORT`
   environment variable if needed.

## Configuration

See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for Docker, Compose, and environment details (including how to test your deployment using `curl_domain_webhook.sh`).

Set `DEBUG_LOGGING=true` to log full webhook request bodies and client IPs when troubleshooting. Leave it unset or `false` in production to avoid storing sensitive data.

## Slack Integration

Configure either `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for incoming webhooks or `SLACK_TOKEN` with `chat:write` permissions and `SLACK_CHANNEL` for OAuth-based posting. Optionally set `SLACK_NOTIFY` to control which events are sent (`success`, `failure`). When enabled, AlertBridge will post formatted messages to the specified Slack channel whenever orders succeed or fail. See [docs/slack.md](docs/slack.md) for full setup instructions.

## Webhook Format

See [`docs/webhook.md`](docs/webhook.md) for full details and examples.

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics are available at `/metrics`:

- `order_total{bot,side}`: Counter of processed orders

## Health Check

The `/healthz` endpoint returns `200 OK` and can be used for container liveness checks.

## Runbook
See [docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md) for deployment, monitoring, and rollback steps.

## Privacy

See [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) for information on how webhook payloads are logged, how long logs are kept, and how to request deletion.
